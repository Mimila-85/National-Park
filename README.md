 # National Park
This application allows the user to search for National Parks by state.

## Description
By selecting a state from the dropdown menu, a list of national parks located in that state will appear. Selecting a park by clicking on its button will provide further information about the park, including information about park activities, campgrounds, and any current alerts for the park. The app will also generate a 5-day forecast for the city where the park is located, giving data for temperature, wind speed, and humidity, as well as an icon indicating the weather such as rain or overcast conditions. Users may also use a button to favorite a park, allowing them to save and quickly find parks. This data will be kept in local storage until the green "trash can" icon is selected. This app uses the Open Weather Map data API and the NPS Park API.
